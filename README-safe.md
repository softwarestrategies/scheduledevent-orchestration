# ScheduledEvent Orchestration
## ✨ Overview

Sometime we need to schedule events/jobs to be carried out in the future at varying times (versus fixed).  This project contains examples of different ways to do this using Spring Boot:
- Using a combination of AWS EventBridge Scheduler and homegrown on-premise systems
- Using a fully-homegrown on-premise system

The goal is to be able to safe handle millions of 10M+ events per day.
